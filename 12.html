    I feel really strongly about not reading this poem and the painful disappointment it houses —in addition to hopeful speculation—as a call for presidential reform, but  as a testament to the historical function of “presidency” as a term: a material investment in militarized hierarchy. A measure of distance created and maintained. Still I would argue that Leonard’s poem offers an act of re-programming; presidency <span id="visible"><a href="13.html">shapeshifts</a></span> as it is <span id="visible">re-inhabited and</span> thus <span id="visible">re-coded</span> by Leonard’s imagination.
