Hi, i‚Äôm char (they/them) - today, I want us to write an email.

Not just any email, but any email would do and it would be special because it encompasses the alchemy of our collective presence today.

Over the last 10 weeks, something that has really stuck with me is this question of language as technology. I feel compelled by the assertion that the words we use, have access to, and make with others, are forms of social code.

They do and should matter.

 I often struggle with language‚Äînot only saying what I mean, but knowing what it is I mean in the first place and figuring how to hodge podge that meaning together with the words I‚Äôve been given, whose histories are embedded in their use.

Along this line, part of the implication of words as tech is that language is a technology of violence as well as of speculation. The word technology itself holds material and symbolic violence‚Äîthe violence of surveillance apparatus and militarized tech‚Äîas well as speculative possibility and craftiness: the technology, digital or otherwise, that bubbles up as a byproduct of the collaboration between people working together to solve a ‚Äúproblem.‚Äù

About halfway through this class, I was having a conversation with my parents about Prison Industrial Complex abolition and the U.S. Constitution. I asked them, just like I asked you today: ‚ÄúWhat would it look like if the government/government documents you lived with were programmed by someone who loved you?‚Äù I wanted to expand Melanie‚Äôs question to consider all social life as programmatic, including and in excess of software.

In many ways, the government has already been programmed for my parents, or people ‚Äúlike‚Äù them - white and middle class, living in an urban area. However, I got the sense that it was the first time they had been approached with the invitation to consider the state of their governance as fluid and centered around pleasure and connectivity rather than a multi-pronged top-down exercise of power.

Like the gift of re-imagination in Neta‚Äôs zine workshop, this invitation is also a gesture towards abolition: a refusal against the mandate that capitalist, colonial governance is ‚Äústatic‚Äù and an act of faith that collective liberation can and will happen.

Often during election time, Zoe Leonard‚Äôs poem I Want A President circulates in my social media circles. This time around, it struck me that the poem is a good example of a response to the question I asked my parents. In the poem, Leonard puts the language of Presidency in proximity with people who are often forcefully removed from that title. She is clear:

‚ÄúI want a Dyke for president.‚Äù

I feel really strongly about not reading this poem and the painful disappointment it houses ‚Äîin addition to hopeful speculation‚Äîas a call for presidential reform, but  as a testament to the historical function of ‚Äúpresidency‚Äù as a term: a material investment in militarized hierarchy. A measure of distance created and maintained. Still I would argue that Leonard‚Äôs poem offers an act of re-programming; presidency shapeshifts as it is re-inhabited and thus re-coded by Leonard‚Äôs imagination.

So, to return to the email, the final part of this presentation takes the form of a gift that we can give to each other. üíù Something that we have made together, which I will  format and send back to you using code. The library made from our text will be programmatically transformed into a poem that takes inspiration from Zoe Leonard‚Äôs work, meshing our responses with her speculative form. So, with the last minute or so, I‚Äôll leave this poem on the screen, and leave some space for people to send in more responses, send email contacts if they want to receive the poem, and to read it if they‚Äôd like.

Alrighty - that‚Äôs five minutes! Thank you all again so much for collaborating, I look forward to sharing the email poem we‚Äôve made together. :)
