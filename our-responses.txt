i would be able to take a walk and sit among trees and bugs  and moss, always. access to nature would not be a luxury. it would be there like the ground is there.
it would be soft and squishy
there will be space. a cross between minimalism and all the colors available. the would be words i can pick and choose to make my own poem or story and it would give me new ones that I didn't know. there would be flowers and sounds. and pictures of my son.
