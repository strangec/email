So, to return to the email, the final part of this presentation takes the form of a gift that we can give to each other. <span id="visible"><a href="14.html">💝</a></span>Something that we have made together, which I will  format and send back to you using code. The library made from our text will be programmatically transformed into a poem that takes inspiration from Zoe Leonard’s work, meshing our responses with her speculative form. So, with the last minute or so, I’ll leave this poem on the screen, and leave some space for people to send in more responses, send email contacts if they want to receive the poem, and to read it if they’d like.
