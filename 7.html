    About halfway through this class, I was having a conversation with my parents about Prison Industrial Complex abolition and the U.S. Constitution. I asked them, just like I asked you today: <a href="8.html">“What would it look like if the government/government documents you lived with were programmed by someone who loved you?”</a> I wanted to expand Melanie’s question to consider all social life as programmatic, including and in excess of software.
